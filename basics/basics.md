# The Basics

How do you add two strings together as one string? In other words, how do you use 'interpolation'?

- Use double quotes and `#{expression}`.

How do you use the %operator, division or both to get the thousands, hundreds, tens, in one place of a 4 digit number?

How do you store a list of movies and the release year in a hash?

How do you store dates in an array?

How do you write a program that outputs the factorial of a number?
1. Write a method that accepts a number as a parameter.
2. Check that the number is a integer.
3. If the number is not an integer, then return early and tell the user they made an error.
4. Create a new variable, `count`, and set it equal to the number. This count will be used to do the loop.
5. While the count is  greater than one set the number equal to the number of times the count minus one.
6. Print the number that remains after the loop finishes onto the screen.
7. Call the factorial method you wrote.

What does the following error message tell you?

```rb
SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'
```

- Instead of getting a right brace, we put a parentheses on line two.


How do you calculate the squares of three float numbers and output the results to the screen?
