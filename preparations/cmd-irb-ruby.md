# Command line and irb

What is the difference between the command line and the interactive Ruby environment (irb)?

The command line will run different files, to do things. The irb is one of those files that can run things. Running commands in the irb will be running Ruby commands. Running Ruby program for the command line involves calling the Ruby program and passing in the script that was written and then having the Ruby program doing the interpretation and execution of the code.
