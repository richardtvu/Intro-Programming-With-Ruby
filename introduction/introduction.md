# Introduction to Ruby notes

Why did Ruby get created?
- To promote fun and productivity for programmers
- Focus on code that humans can understand over focusing


Why did Motz create Ruby? Motz wanted to produce a programming language optimize for programmer productivity and happiness. Basically, he wanted a language that would help us get things done because the language is easy to read and easy to use.

 

What is abstraction and interfaces? Abstraction is separating what something does, such as a feature, from how to implement that feature. For instance, a calculator can do multiplication, addition, division, and subtraction. These operations are features, which means that these features are the what involved in abstraction. The how to implement those features is going to involve circuits, electricity, physics, math, and a variety of other details. These details are called implementation details and can be pretty difficult. By separating what from how, you and I can use calculators without having to worry about physics, electricity, or other difficult things. We can just focus on what we want to do. Interfaces are the ways in which we interact with software to do something but without having to worry about how to do something. In other words, the butt is a calculator are part of the interface that allows us to interact with electrical circuits in the calculator. Another type of interface is our keyboard. Our keyboard has buttons that we press. We often might want to send a message or write a sentence. This purpose is our what. The keyboard has legible circus themselves to send signals to the computer and  these signals are part of the implementation details. 

 

How is Ruby an example of abstraction? Ruby is written in C, which translates to assembly, which translates to machine language, which can finally be understood by a computer. If we wanted to directly talk to computers, we would want to be able to manipulate electricity to flip switches on and off in the central processing unit of the computer. There are probably millions of the little switches or even more considering the modern-day advances in computer technology. By using machine language, we don't have to worry about sending electrical signals ourselves. Instead, we use zeros and ones. However, zeros and ones are difficult to understand, so we can use assembly to turn the zeros and ones into symbols.  But the symbols are also difficult to understand, so you can translate them into code, C.  but see itself is also somewhat difficult to understand, so we translate that into Ruby which is closer to modern-day English.  as you can see, as we go from  the computer  legible signals up this chain back up to Ruby, we'll worry about less and less details and instead can just focus on what we want to do. Therefore, Ruby is a highly abstracted programming language, hence it is called a high-level programming language.

 

What quality is vital to being a programmer?

At the very least, if you would like to be a productive and happy programmer, patience is vital.  patience is taking time to do exercises and apply what you learn.  Patience allows for deeper and clearer thinking.

 

How does launch school recommend we read this book,  INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING WITH RUBY? Do all the exercises. By doing all the exercises, we build procedural memory that allows us to automate our understanding of programming syntax in the fundamentals. Automating these fundamentals or making the fundamental 2nd nature to us is like doing scales for learning how to play a musical instrument. By practicing scales, we are able to internalize the scales, which allows us to stop thinking about the scales and instead think about how we can better play the actual music. If we don't practice scales, when were trying to play some music, then will often get stuck trying to play the right note instead of focusing on playing the right set of notes or the right song.  Similarly,making the programming fundamental 2nd nature to less will allow us to stop focusing on syntax and instead focus on actually solving problems and on creating solutions.
